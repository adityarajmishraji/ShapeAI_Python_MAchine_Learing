2. Python + Matplotlib = Data Visualization

3. Python + Flask = Web Application

4. Python + Pygame = Game Development

5. Python + PyQt = Desktop Application

6. Python + TenserFlow = Machine Learning

7. Python + FastAPI = API Development

8. Python + Kivy = Mobile Devlopment

9. Python + Pandas = Data Analysis

10. Python + NumPy = Scientific Computing


And many more libraries are used to resolve the day to day life problem.
